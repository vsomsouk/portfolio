      <p class="p">Hi there! My name is Vanida, and I am currently a full stack web development student at UofM Coding Boot Camp.
        I am also a Project Support Specialist for a medical products company.</p>
        
        <p class="p">I graduated from Minnesota State University, Mankato 
          with Bachelor's Degree of Science in Parks, Recreation & Leisure Services - Program Management. I started my career 
          in the events industry utilizing my program management skills. I always had an interest in technology, so I decided
          to make a change in my career path and dive into web development.</p>

        <p class="p">On my free time, I have a passion for music and love going to live music shows. I also like exploring new foods in the restaurant
        scene and going out for nature walks!
      </a></p>
